            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ethical hacking is the practice of using technical knowledge, cybersecurity principles, and ethics to
                identify and fix vulnerabilities in computer systems to improve their security. Unlike malicious
                hacking, ethical hacking is conducted with permission and legally to protect information and prevent
                cyber attacks.</p>
            <p><strong>DO NOT CONFUSE CYBERCRIMINALS WITH HACKERS!</strong></p>

            <h2>Why is Ethical Hacking Important?</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Data Protection:</strong> Helps to protect sensitive information of individuals and
                organizations.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Security Improvement:</strong> Identifies and fixes vulnerabilities before they can be
                exploited.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensures compliance with security regulations and standards.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Awareness and Education:</strong> Promotes a better understanding of security threats and
                the importance of good practices.</p>

            <h2>Basic Concepts Every Hacker Should Know</h2>
            <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> A flaw in the code of a system or device.</p>
            <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> A weakness in a system that can be exploited.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploit:</strong> Code that takes advantage of a vulnerability.</p>
            <p><strong>Payload:</strong> The code or data introduced into a vulnerable system.</p>
            <p><strong>Backdoor:</strong> A "secret entry" already included in the system in most cases, used for
                remote control.</p>
            <p><strong>Reverse Shell:</strong> A process where the attacker's machine connects to the victim's
                machine to send commands for execution.</p>
            <p><strong>CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):</strong> A public cataloging system that
                identifies and lists known security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):</strong> A comprehensive list of known programming,
                design, and architectural errors that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Blue Team:</strong> The people responsible for defending an organization's systems and
                networks.</p>
            <p><strong>Red Team:</strong> Simulates attacks by malicious hackers to assess the effectiveness of
                defense measures.</p>

            <h2>Phases of Ethical Hacking</h2>

            <h3>1. RECONNAISSANCE</h3>
            <p>Collecting information about the target.</p>
            <p><strong>Commands to gather information about a domain:</strong></p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>whois example.com</code></pre><br>
                <pre><code>nslookup example.com</code></pre><br>
                <pre><code>dig example.com</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3>2. SCANNING</h3>
            <p>Identifying open ports and vulnerable services.</p>
            <p><strong>Using Nmap to scan networks and ports.</strong> </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>nmap -T5 -sS -sV -sC -vvv example.com</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explanation of important flags:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <p><code>-T5</code>: Adjusts the speed of the scan, with T0 being the slowest and T5 the fastest.</p>
                <p><code>-sS</code>: The quickest way to scan popular ports using the TCP protocol.</p>
                <p><code>-sV</code>: Analyzes open ports to determine the service/version.</p>
                <p><code>-sC</code>: Uses default scripts.</p>
                <p><code>-vvv</code>: Increases the level of detail in the descriptions and responses provided by the
                    Nmap command.</p>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other useful commands:</strong></p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>nikto -url example.com</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Scans the network (not highly recommended as it makes a lot of noise and can be detected by the blue
                team).</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>dirb http://example.com</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Provides information on the technologies and versions used by the web.</p>

            <h3>3. GAINING ACCESS</h3>
            <p>Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to systems or networks.</p>
            <P>After gathering information about exposed services and versions used, you can check
                websites like <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/"> Exploit-DB</a> to see if there
                are associated CVEs and use tools like <a href="https://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a>
                to exploit the vulnerabilities.</P>
            <p>Once the exploit is executed, the attacker can gain access to system resources,
                such as files, user accounts, or even full control over the system through
                techniques like a reverse shell.</p>

            <h3>4. MAINTAINING ACCESS</h3>
            <p>Securing access for future intrusions.</p>
            <p>Creating a persistent user on a compromised Linux system:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>sudo useradd -m hacker</code></pre><br>
                <pre><code>sudo passwd hacker</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>Backdoors allow easy re-access to the system in the future.</p>

            <h3>5. COVERING TRACKS</h3>
            <p>Erasing traces to avoid detection.</p>
            <p>Deleting logs on a Linux system:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>echo > /var/log/auth.log</code></pre><br>
                <pre><code>echo > /var/log/syslog</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h2>There you Have Some Examples of Vulnerabilities</h2>

            <p><strong>> SQL Injection: </strong>Injecting malicious SQL code into website input fields to access the
                database.
            </p>
            <p><strong>> Cross-site Scripting (XSS): </strong>Injecting malicious JavaScript code into web pages to
                steal cookies or redirect users to malicious sites.</p>
            <p><strong>> Path Traversal: </strong>Manipulating URL parameters or HTTP requests to access files outside
                the web directory to which the user should have access.</p>
            <p><strong>> Command Injection: </strong>Similar to SQL injection, but in this case, operating system
                commands
                are injected into input fields.</p>
            <p><strong>> File Upload: </strong>This attack exploits the file upload functionalities of an application to
                upload
                malicious files, such as scripts, executables, or files that allow code execution on the server.</p>
            <p><strong>> Denial of Service (DoS): </strong>Flooding a system with requests to make it inaccessible to
                legitimate users.</p>
